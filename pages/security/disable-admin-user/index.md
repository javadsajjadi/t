# Disable admin user
<!-- position: 1 -->

By default, Bluditcreates a user called `admin` as the administrator for the system. Bludit uses this user for password recovery events; if you are going to delete another user and you want to keep his content, this content is assigned to the `admin` user.

For security reasons you can disable this user.

## How to disable the admin user
If you are going to disable the Administrator of the system, ensure you have another user with the Administrator role.

- Go to the Admin Panel
- Manage > Users > admin
- Edit User > Status > Disable the user

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Enable the user</div>
To enable the user again, you must set a new password.
</div>
