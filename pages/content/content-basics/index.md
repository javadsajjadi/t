بلودیت پێنج جۆر ناوەرۆکی هەیە

<h2 id="pages">پەڕەکان</h2>
Pages can be treated as a regular `page` or a `post` (blog post). In the end, the concept of `page` is just a name. Pages can be ordered by `date` or by `position`.

For example, if you are interested in creating a blog, you can order the pages by `date`. If you are interested in creating a website with the pages in a specific order, you can order the pages by `position`.

Bludit orders the pages by `date` by default, but you can change this from the settings by going to **Settings > General > Advanced > Order content by**.

<h2 id="static">نەجولاو</h2>
Static pages are set to *not* appear on the homepage; these pages are still published, and can be accessed via the URL. These kind of pages are useful for pages such as `About`, `Terms and conditions`, `Privacy`, or `Contact us`. Themes will generally show links to these pages at the top of your site.

To create this kind of page, while you are creating the content, go to the **Options** tab, and select the type **Type > Static**.

<h2 id="sticky">لکاو</h2>
Sticky pages are the same as a normal page, but appear before all other published pages on the home page.

---

<h2 id="draft">پێشنووس</h2>
Draft pages allow the user to create content without publishing it until it's ready. Draft pages are only accessible via the administration panel.

---

<h2 id="scheduled">بەرنامەڕێژکراو</h2>
Scheduled pages are not published until a time and date set by the user. You can schedule a page to publish itself in the next few minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months.

To select the date, go to the **Options** tab and set the date in the **Date** field while you are creating the content.
