# How to change the editor
<!-- position: 6 -->

By default, Bludit uses the [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/) Editor - a simple and clean HTML editor. But you can also choose SimpleMDE which supports Markdown Code. TinyMCE and SimpleMDE are pre-installed on Bludit by default; both are plugins and you can find them in the plugin section.

## How to switch from TinyMCE to SimpleMDE
- Log in into the **Admin panel**.
- Go to **Plugins** on the left menu.
- Find the plugin **TinyMCE** and click on the **Deactivate** button.
- Find the plugin **SimpleMDE** and click on the button **Activate** button.
- You have now enabled SimpleMDE as your content editor.
