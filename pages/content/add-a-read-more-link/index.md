You can split the content of the page into two parts. The first part will be visible on the homepage with a `Read more` button.

To split the content, click on the `Page Break` button, which is located on the toolbar above the main text editor.

Here's a video with all the steps:
<div class="videoWrapper">
	<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ev5kNwFyVdY?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

You can do the same thing in the Markdown editor by adding the tag `<!-- pagebreak -->`.
```
This is the first part of the content of the page.

<!-- pagebreak -->

This is the second part of the page.
```
